# Key points before start:
- The analysis only for original ratings (no retweets).
- Assessing and cleaning the entire dataset completely would require a lot of time. Therefore, the requirements of this project are only to assess and clean at least 8 quality issues and at least 2 tidiness issues in this dataset.
- Cleaning includes merging individual pieces of data according to the rules of tidy data.
- The fact that the rating numerators are greater than the denominators does not need to be cleaned. This unique rating system is a big part of the popularity of WeRateDogs.
- Do not need to gather the tweets beyond August 1st, 2017. duo to won't be able to gather the image predictions for these tweets since you don't have access to the algorithm used.
